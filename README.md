# NLP Coding Interview Practice

This repository is a fast-practice bank of NLP coding interview questions with concise, runnable Python solutions. No courses, just problems and answers.

## How to use
- Pick a topic below, open the problem, then run the matching solution.
- Each `solution_*.py` file is self-contained and runnable with example I/O.
- Dependencies are standard Python NLP stacks (installed on demand in scripts when needed) [[memory:4362663]].
