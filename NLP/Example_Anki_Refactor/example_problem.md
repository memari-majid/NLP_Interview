# Example: Anki-Optimized Solution Structure

**Time: 20 minutes**

Implement a simple spell checker that:
1. Calculates edit distance between words
2. Finds candidate corrections from a dictionary
3. Ranks candidates by frequency

```python
def spell_checker(word: str, dictionary: Dict[str, int]) -> List[str]:
    """
    Find best spelling corrections.
    
    Args:
        word: Potentially misspelled word
        dictionary: Dict of {correct_word: frequency}
        
    Returns:
        Top 3 candidate corrections
    """
    pass
```

This example shows how to structure solutions for optimal Anki card generation.
