## üéØ Key Interview Topics

### Must-Know Concepts
1. **Attention Mechanism**: How it works, why it's important
2. **BERT vs GPT**: Architecture differences, use cases
3. **Embeddings**: Static vs contextual, training methods
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: When to use which metric
5. **Fine-tuning**: Strategies, preventing catastrophic forgetting

### Common Coding Questions
1. Implement TF-IDF from scratch
2. Build a simple tokenizer
3. Calculate cosine similarity
4. Implement beam search
5. Design a text preprocessing pipeline

### System Design Topics
1. Design a search engine
2. Build a chatbot system
3. Create a content moderation system
4. Design a recommendation system with NLP
5. Build a real-time translation service

## üìä Quick Formulas

**TF-IDF**: `TF-IDF = TF(t,d) √ó log(N/DF(t))`

**Attention**: `Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/‚àöd_k)V`

**F1 Score**: `F1 = 2 √ó (precision √ó recall) / (precision + recall)`

**Perplexity**: `PPL = exp(-1/N Œ£ log P(w_i|context))`

## üõ†Ô∏è Essential Code Snippets

### Load Pre-trained Model
```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```

### Semantic Similarity
```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
```

### Quick Classification Pipeline
```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis')
result = classifier("I love this!")
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

1. **Batching**: Process multiple examples together
2. **Caching**: Store preprocessed data and embeddings
3. **Quantization**: Reduce model precision (FP32 ‚Üí INT8)
