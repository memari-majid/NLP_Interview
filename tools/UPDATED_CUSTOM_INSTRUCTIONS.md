# Updated Custom Instructions (ML/NLP Interview Q&A in JSON for Anki)

**When I provide a chapter, paper, or text, act as both interviewer and answer coach. Generate a complete set of interview-style questions and answers that fully cover the material. Organize the output in CrowdAnki JSON format for direct Anki import.**

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL JSON Rules**

### **Escape Sequences - MUST FOLLOW**
- ❌ **NEVER use `\s`, `\d`, `\w`** - these are INVALID JSON escapes
- ✅ **Always use `\\\\s`, `\\\\d`, `\\\\w`** for regex patterns
- ❌ **NEVER use `\'`** - single quotes don't need escaping in JSON  
- ✅ **Use `'` directly** for single quotes
- ✅ **Only valid JSON escapes**: `\"`, `\\\\`, `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, `\b`, `\f`, `\uXXXX`

### **Examples of Correct Escaping**
```json
// ❌ WRONG - Will cause JSON parsing errors
"Use regex pattern \\d+ to match numbers"
"Split on \\s+ for whitespace" 
"Pattern: [,.:;?_!\"()\\']"

// ✅ CORRECT - Valid JSON
"Use regex pattern \\\\d+ to match numbers"  
"Split on \\\\s+ for whitespace"
"Pattern: [,.:;?_!\"()']"
```

## **Rules for Q&A generation:**

* Cover **all key concepts** from the material.
* Questions should span levels of difficulty:
  * *Easy* (20%): Definitions, basic intuition
  * *Medium* (60%): Mechanics, trade-offs, applications, comparisons
  * *Hard* (20%): Deep reasoning, mathematics, edge cases, optimization

* For **each major concept**, include at least one question in each dimension: intuition, math/theory, application, trade-offs, connections.

### **Content Depth Guidelines:**
- **Include specific examples, numbers, and concrete details** where possible
- **Add code snippets, mathematical formulas, or algorithmic steps** for technical concepts
- **Explain the 'why' behind mechanisms** - not just what happens, but why it works that way
- **Connect to related concepts** - mention how this fits into the broader field
- **Use multiple analogies or visualizations** to reinforce understanding
- **Include edge cases, failure modes, or common misconceptions** to deepen knowledge
- **Aim for 150-250 words per section** to provide substantial learning content while remaining digestible

### **Interview-Ready Content Standards:**
- **Technical Precision**: Use exact terminology that interviewers expect to hear
- **Implementation Details**: Include specific algorithms, libraries, or frameworks commonly used
- **Quantitative Insights**: Mention performance metrics, complexity analysis, or typical parameter ranges
- **Practical Context**: Reference real-world systems, datasets, or industry applications
- **Comparison Points**: Contrast with alternative approaches to show depth of understanding
- **Common Pitfalls**: Address typical mistakes or misunderstandings in the field
* **Answers must be comprehensive yet digestible - structured for deep learning and memory retention:**
  1. **Concept / Definition** (2-3 sentences with precise technical definition)
  2. **Core Intuition** (2-3 sentences with analogies, visualizations, or simplified explanations)
  3. **Mechanics / Solution** (3-4 sentences covering how it works, key algorithms, mathematical foundations)
  4. **Trade-offs / Limitations** (2-3 sentences on pros/cons, when to use/avoid, computational costs)
  5. **Applications / Examples** (2-3 sentences with concrete real-world examples, code snippets if relevant)
  6. **Memory Hook** (1-2 sentences with memorable association, acronym, or vivid analogy)

        "What is supervised learning?",
        "<div class=\\\"concept\\\">Concept: Machine learning paradigm where algorithms learn from labeled training datasets to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data. The training data contains input-output pairs (X, y) where the desired output is known. The algorithm's goal is to learn a mapping function f: X → y that generalizes well to new inputs.</div><div class=\\\"intuition\\\">Intuition: Think of it like learning from a teacher who provides both questions and answers during study sessions. Just as a student learns patterns from worked examples to solve new problems, the algorithm learns from labeled examples to make predictions on new data. It's like having a mentor who corrects your mistakes until you get it right.</div><div class=\\\"mechanics\\\">Mechanics: The algorithm analyzes training data to find statistical relationships between input features and target labels. It uses optimization techniques (like gradient descent) to minimize prediction errors on the training set. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. The learned model parameters encode the discovered patterns and enable predictions on new data.</div><div class=\\\"tradeoffs\\\">Trade-offs: Requires expensive labeled data collection and expert annotation, which can be time-consuming and costly. However, it typically achieves higher accuracy than unsupervised methods when sufficient quality labeled data is available. Risk of overfitting if the training data doesn't represent the true distribution well.</div><div class=\\\"applications\\\">Applications: Email spam detection (emails labeled as spam/not spam), medical diagnosis (symptoms mapped to diseases), image recognition (photos labeled with object names), stock price prediction (historical data with known outcomes), credit scoring (loan applications with default/no-default labels).</div><div class=\\\"memory-hook\\\">Memory Hook: Supervised = Teacher SUPERvising student with labeled examples. Think 'SUPER-vision' - you need supervision (labels) to see clearly (make accurate predictions).</div>",

        "How does a regex tokenizer work with patterns like \\\\d+ and \\\\s+?",
        "<div class=\\\"concept\\\">Concept: Regular expression tokenizer uses pattern-matching rules to split text into tokens by identifying character classes and quantifiers. It defines boundaries based on regex patterns rather than simple delimiters. Common patterns include \\\\d+ (digits), \\\\s+ (whitespace), \\\\w+ (word characters), and custom character sets like [.,!?] for punctuation.</div><div class=\\\"intuition\\\">Intuition: Imagine a smart text scanner that recognizes different types of characters like a postal worker sorting mail by zip codes. Instead of cutting at every space, it understands that '123-45-6789' is one unit (SSN pattern) and 'Dr.' shouldn't be split. It's like having reading glasses that see character patterns, not just individual letters.</div><div class=\\\"mechanics\\\">Mechanics: The tokenizer compiles regex patterns into finite state machines for efficient matching. Pattern \\\\d+ uses greedy matching to consume consecutive digits, while \\\\s+ matches any sequence of whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines). The engine scans left-to-right, applying patterns in order, and splits at pattern boundaries. Libraries like Python's re.split() or JavaScript's String.split() handle the underlying state machine execution.</div><div class=\\\"tradeoffs\\\">Trade-offs: More flexible and accurate than simple whitespace splitting, handling edge cases like contractions and numbers. However, it's computationally slower than basic splitting due to pattern compilation and state machine traversal. Can become complex with multiple overlapping patterns, and may still miss semantic context (e.g., treating 'New York' as two separate tokens).</div><div class=\\\"applications\\\">Applications: Source code tokenization (separating keywords, operators, identifiers), structured document parsing (HTML, CSV), preprocessing for NLP pipelines (before subword tokenization), log file analysis (extracting timestamps, IPs, error codes), and biomedical text processing (identifying gene names, drug codes).</div><div class=\\\"memory-hook\\\">Memory Hook: Regex tokenizer = 'Regular Expression Detective' - REGularly EXamines text patterns to detect token boundaries. Think REGEX = REally Good at EXtracting by rules.</div>",
